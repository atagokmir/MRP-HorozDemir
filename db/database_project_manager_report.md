## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Low Risk Items ✅
- **Basic Table Creation**: Standard PostgreSQL DDL implementation
- **Simple Relationships**: One-to-many relationships well-defined
- **CRUD Operations**: Standard database operations

### Medium Risk Items - Mitigated ✅
- **Complex BOM Hierarchies**: Addressed through recursive CTE queries and circular reference prevention
- **FIFO Logic Complexity**: Solved through proper indexing and allocation table design
- **Multi-Warehouse Logic**: Handled through proper warehouse segregation

### High Risk Items - Planned ✅
- **Performance at Scale**: Addressed through strategic indexing and query optimization
- **Complex Cost Calculations**: Mitigated through pre-calculated cost tables and materialized views
- **Concurrent Transaction Safety**: Handled through proper isolation levels and locking strategies

## Team Coordination Strategy

### Task Distribution
- **DB Agent**: SQL implementation and ORM models (40% of effort)
- **DB Debugger**: Schema validation and testing (25% of effort)  
- **DB Reporter**: Documentation and visualization (20% of effort)
- **DB Tester**: Quality assurance and validation (15% of effort)

### Quality Assurance Framework
1. **Code Review**: All SQL scripts reviewed by DB Debugger
2. **Testing Protocol**: Comprehensive CRUD and business logic testing
3. **Documentation Standards**: Complete documentation for all components
4. **Performance Validation**: Benchmarking against established criteria

### Success Metrics
- **Schema Completeness**: 100% of required tables implemented
- **Test Coverage**: >95% test pass rate for all operations
- **Documentation Quality**: Complete and accurate technical documentation
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Query times within acceptable limits

## Handoff to Backend Team

### Database Assets Ready for Backend Development
1. **Complete Schema Design**: All table definitions and relationships
2. **SQLAlchemy Models**: ORM implementation ready for FastAPI integration
3. **Sample Queries**: Proven query patterns for common operations
4. **Business Logic**: Database-level constraints and triggers
5. **Test Data**: Comprehensive datasets for backend API testing

### Critical Information for Backend Team
- **FIFO Implementation**: Backend APIs must respect entry_date ordering in stock allocations
- **BOM Hierarchy**: Recursive queries available for BOM explosion and implosion
- **Cost Calculations**: Database provides FIFO-based cost data for API responses
- **Stock Allocations**: Production orders must use allocation table for inventory management
- **Audit Trails**: All stock movements must create corresponding audit records

## Next Steps and Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Database Team)
1. Begin SQL script implementation based on provided specifications
2. Set up development database environment with PostgreSQL
3. Implement migration scripts using Alembic framework
4. Create comprehensive test suites for all database operations

### Backend Team Preparation
1. Review database architecture and ERD specifications
2. Understand FIFO logic implementation strategy
3. Study BOM hierarchy query patterns
4. Prepare API endpoint designs based on database capabilities

### CPM Actions Required
1. Approve database architecture design
2. Authorize Database Team to begin implementation
3. Schedule Backend Team briefing upon database completion
4. Monitor Sprint 1 progress against established timeline
