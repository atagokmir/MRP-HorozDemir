2. **Database Migration:**
   - **Issue:** Development using SQLite, production needs PostgreSQL
   - **Impact:** None for current testing
   - **Note:** Migration planned for deployment phase

3. **Mobile Optimization:**
   - **Issue:** Some complex forms may need mobile layout improvements
   - **Impact:** Usability on small screens
   - **Priority:** Medium - address in future iterations

### Testing Workarounds
**If Backend Issues Occur:**
- Clear browser cache and reload
