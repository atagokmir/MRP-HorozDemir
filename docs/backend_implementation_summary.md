## Key Features Implemented

### FIFO Inventory Logic
```python
# Core FIFO allocation algorithm implemented
- Automatic oldest-batch-first consumption
- Cost calculation based on FIFO order
- Real-time availability checking
- Stock reservation for production planning
```

### Authentication Flow
```python
# Complete JWT-based authentication
- Login with username/password
- Access token (15 min) + Refresh token (7 days)
- Role-based permissions checking
- Token blacklisting on logout
```

### Database Session Management
```python
# Proper session handling with context management
- Automatic commit/rollback
- User context for audit trails
- Connection pooling
- Health monitoring
```

## API Endpoints Implemented

### Core System
- `GET /` - System information
- `GET /health` - Health check with database status
- `GET /version` - Version information

### Authentication
- `POST /auth/login` - User login with JWT tokens
- `POST /auth/refresh` - Refresh access token
- `POST /auth/logout` - Logout and token revocation
- `GET /auth/me` - Current user information
- `PUT /auth/me` - Update user profile
- `POST /auth/change-password` - Change password
- `POST /auth/users` - Create user (admin only)
- `GET /auth/users` - List users (admin only)
- `PUT /auth/users/{id}` - Update user (admin only)

### Inventory Management
- `GET /inventory/items` - List inventory items (FIFO ordered)
- `GET /inventory/availability/{product_id}` - Check stock availability
- `POST /inventory/stock-in` - Add new inventory stock
- `POST /inventory/stock-out` - Remove stock using FIFO logic
- `POST /inventory/adjust` - Inventory quantity adjustments
- `POST /inventory/transfer` - Transfer stock between warehouses
- `POST /inventory/allocate` - Reserve stock for production (FIFO)
- `GET /inventory/movements` - Stock movement history
- `GET /inventory/critical-stock` - Critical stock level report

### Master Data
- Warehouses, Products, and Suppliers CRUD operations (structure ready)

### Reporting
- Basic reporting endpoints structure (expandable)

## Business Logic Implemented

### 1. FIFO Cost Calculation
- Automatic cost calculation based on entry order
- Weighted average cost for availability reports
- Total cost tracking for all operations

### 2. Stock Reservation System
- Reserve quantities for production planning
- Prevent over-allocation of stock
- Release reservations when not needed

### 3. Quality Control Integration
- Only APPROVED items available for consumption
- QUARANTINE and REJECTED items tracked separately
- Quality status filtering in all operations

### 4. Audit Trail
- Complete movement history for all stock operations
- User tracking for all changes
- Reference tracking to source documents

## Technology Stack

### Backend Framework
- **FastAPI**: High-performance async API framework
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and serialization
- **SQLAlchemy**: ORM with relationship management
- **Alembic**: Database migration management

### Security
- **JWT**: Secure token-based authentication
- **bcrypt**: Password hashing
- **Rate Limiting**: API abuse prevention
- **CORS**: Cross-origin request security

### Database
