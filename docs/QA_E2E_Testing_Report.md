### 3. Inventory Management and FIFO ❌ CRITICAL FAILURE

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Stock-in operations (API level)
- ❌ Inventory tracking (FAILED)
- ❌ FIFO cost calculations (FAILED)
- ❌ Stock-out operations (FAILED)

**CRITICAL FINDING:**
The inventory system has a severe data integrity issue:

1. **Stock-in operations report success** but do not actually update inventory levels
2. **Inventory items endpoint shows empty results** despite successful stock-in operations
3. **Stock availability shows 0 units** even after adding 800 units via stock-in
4. **FIFO calculations cannot be tested** due to inventory not being recorded

**Test Data:**
- Added Batch 1: 500 units at $25.50 (reported success)
- Added Batch 2: 300 units at $27.00 (reported success)
- Total expected inventory: 800 units
- **Actual inventory shown: 0 units**

This represents a complete failure of the core business functionality.

### 4. Stock Operations ❌ FAILED

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Stock-in API endpoint functional
- ❌ Stock-out operations fail due to inventory issues
- ❌ Inventory movements tracking non-functional
- ❌ Batch tracking broken

**Issues:**
- Stock-out operations fail with "Insufficient stock" error
- No inventory movements recorded despite operations
- FIFO allocation cannot be validated

### 5. Critical Stock Alerts and Reporting ⚠️ LIMITED FUNCTIONALITY

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Critical stock alerts endpoint functional
- ✅ Inventory summary report endpoint accessible
- ❌ No meaningful data due to inventory issues

**Results:**
- Endpoints respond correctly but return empty data
- Reports cannot be validated without actual inventory data

### 6. Frontend and User Interface ✅ FUNCTIONAL

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Frontend application loads correctly
- ✅ HTML structure and styling appear functional
- ✅ React application framework operational

**Results:**
- Next.js application serves correctly
- CSS and JavaScript assets load properly
- Application shows loading states appropriately

## Critical Issues Summary

### Issue #1: Schema-Database Model Mismatch (CRITICAL)
**Impact:** Prevents warehouse and supplier creation
**Details:** 
- Database model defines roles: `admin`, `manager`, `operator`, `viewer`
- Schema validation expects: `admin`, `production_manager`, `inventory_clerk`, `procurement_officer`, `viewer`
- Warehouse model missing `description` field support
- Supplier model missing `tax_number` field support

### Issue #2: Inventory System Data Integrity Failure (CRITICAL)
**Impact:** Core business functionality non-operational
**Details:**
- Stock-in operations don't update inventory tables
- Inventory availability always shows 0
- FIFO calculations impossible to validate
- Stock-out operations fail due to apparent 0 inventory

### Issue #3: Inventory Items Listing Broken (CRITICAL)
**Impact:** Cannot view or manage inventory
**Details:**
- Error: `name 'WarehouseSummary' is not defined`
- API endpoint returns internal server error
- Prevents inventory monitoring and management

### Issue #4: Stock Movement Tracking Non-functional (HIGH)
**Impact:** No audit trail for inventory changes
**Details:**
- No movements recorded despite stock operations
- Cannot track FIFO allocation or cost calculations
- Compliance and auditing impossible

### Issue #5: BOM and Production System Untestable (HIGH)
**Impact:** Cannot validate core MRP functionality
**Details:**
- Dependent on inventory system functionality
- FIFO cost calculations cannot be verified
- Production order workflows cannot be tested

- ❌ FIFO cost calculations accurate
- ❌ Inventory tracking functional
- ❌ Master data management complete

---

## Conclusion

The Horoz Demir MRP system shows promise in its architecture and user interface design, but critical data integrity issues prevent production deployment. The inventory management system, which is core to any MRP system, has fundamental problems that render it non-functional.

**Recommendation: HOLD PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT** until critical issues are resolved and comprehensive testing validates all business workflows.

The development team should prioritize:
1. Inventory system data integrity fixes
2. Schema-database alignment
3. Complete end-to-end workflow testing

Once these issues are resolved, the system should undergo another complete QA cycle before production consideration.

---

**Report Status:** COMPLETE  
**Next Action:** Forward to QA Debugger for immediate issue resolution  
**Follow-up Required:** Re-test after critical fixes are implemented
