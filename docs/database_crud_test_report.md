## Critical Issues and Recommendations

### Issues Identified

#### 🔴 Critical Issues
None identified. All core database operations are functioning correctly.

#### 🟡 Medium Priority Issues

1. **Complex Query Performance**
   - Issue: BOM explosions and production allocations may be slow with large datasets
   - Impact: User experience degradation with >10,000 products
   - Recommendation: Implement query optimization and consider materialized views

2. **Missing Indexes**
   - Issue: Some reporting queries lack optimized indexes
   - Impact: Slow reporting performance
   - Recommendation: Add composite indexes for common reporting patterns

#### 🟢 Low Priority Improvements

1. **Database Monitoring**
   - Recommendation: Implement query performance monitoring
   - Add automated performance alerts for slow queries

2. **Data Archiving**
   - Recommendation: Implement data archiving for historical records
   - Create archiving functions for old cost calculations and alerts

### Recommended Improvements

#### Performance Optimizations

1. **Materialized Views for Complex Reports**
```sql
-- Example: Current inventory summary materialized view
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_current_inventory_summary AS
SELECT 
    product_id,
    warehouse_id,
    SUM(available_quantity) as total_available,
    SUM(total_cost) as total_value,
    MIN(entry_date) as oldest_batch_date
FROM inventory_items 
WHERE quality_status = 'APPROVED' 
  AND quantity_in_stock > 0
GROUP BY product_id, warehouse_id;

-- Refresh strategy needed
CREATE INDEX idx_mv_current_inventory ON mv_current_inventory_summary(product_id, warehouse_id);
```

2. **Additional Composite Indexes**
```sql
-- For production order queries
CREATE INDEX idx_production_orders_status_priority ON production_orders(status, priority, planned_start_date)
WHERE status IN ('PLANNED', 'RELEASED', 'IN_PROGRESS');

-- For FIFO allocation optimization  
CREATE INDEX idx_inventory_fifo_allocation ON inventory_items(product_id, warehouse_id, quality_status, entry_date)
WHERE quality_status = 'APPROVED' AND available_quantity > 0;
```

3. **Query Optimization Examples**
```sql
-- Optimized BOM explosion with CTE optimization
WITH RECURSIVE optimized_bom_explosion AS (
    -- Add LIMIT and WHERE clauses for better performance
    SELECT ... FROM bill_of_materials 
    WHERE status = 'ACTIVE' 
      AND effective_date <= CURRENT_DATE 
      AND (expiry_date IS NULL OR expiry_date > CURRENT_DATE)
    LIMIT 1000 -- Prevent runaway recursion
)
-- Continue with recursive logic...
```
