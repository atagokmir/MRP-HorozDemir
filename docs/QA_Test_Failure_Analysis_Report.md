## Critical Failure Analysis

### FAILURE #1: Inventory System Data Integrity Breakdown (CRITICAL SEVERITY)

**Root Cause Category:** Backend Implementation  
**System Component:** Inventory Management API  
**Business Impact:** SEVERE - Core business operations non-functional

#### Technical Analysis
- **Symptom:** Stock-in operations report success but do not update inventory levels
- **Evidence:** API returns success responses, but inventory availability shows 0 units after adding 800 units
- **Root Cause:** Disconnect between API response generation and actual database persistence
- **Code Location:** `/backend/app/api/inventory.py` - `stock_in_operation()` function

#### Detailed Investigation
1. **API Endpoint Analysis:**
   - Stock-in endpoint (`POST /inventory/stock-in`) processes requests successfully
   - Database session operations appear correct with `session.add()` and `session.commit()`
   - Response generation indicates successful operation

2. **Data Persistence Failure:**
   - New inventory items are not persisting to database despite successful API responses
   - Potential issues with database session management or transaction rollback
   - Inventory availability endpoint shows no items despite successful stock-in operations

#### Business Consequences
- **Inventory Tracking:** Completely non-functional
- **Stock Management:** Cannot track or verify stock levels
- **FIFO Calculations:** Impossible to validate due to missing inventory data
- **Production Planning:** Material requirements cannot be calculated
- **Audit Compliance:** No inventory movement records despite operations

#### Team Assignment: **BACKEND TEAM (P0 - IMMEDIATE)**
