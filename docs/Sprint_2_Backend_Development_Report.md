## FIFO Business Logic Implementation

### Core FIFO Algorithm
The system implements strict First-In-First-Out inventory allocation:

**FIFO Ordering Logic:**
```sql
-- Inventory items ordered by entry date for FIFO consumption
ORDER BY entry_date ASC, inventory_item_id ASC
WHERE quality_status = 'APPROVED' AND available_quantity > 0
```

**Key FIFO Features:**
1. **Chronological Consumption:** Oldest stock consumed first based on entry_date
2. **Batch-Level Tracking:** Each inventory item represents a specific batch
3. **Quality Control Integration:** Only APPROVED items available for allocation
4. **Cost Calculation:** Real-time FIFO cost calculations for accurate costing
5. **Reservation System:** Stock allocation for production planning

**FIFO Cost Calculation Example:**
```python
# When allocating 150 units from multiple batches:
# Batch 1: 100 units @ $20.00 (oldest)
# Batch 2: 200 units @ $22.00 (newer)
# 
# FIFO Allocation:
# - Take 100 units from Batch 1 @ $20.00 = $2,000
# - Take 50 units from Batch 2 @ $22.00 = $1,100
# Total Cost: $3,100 (Weighted Average: $20.67/unit)
```

### Quality Status Integration
- **PENDING:** New stock awaiting quality inspection
- **APPROVED:** Available for consumption and allocation
- **REJECTED:** Quarantined, not available for use
- **QUARANTINE:** Under investigation, temporarily unavailable

---

## Security Implementation

### Authentication System
- **JWT Tokens:** Access tokens (15 minutes) + Refresh tokens (7 days)
- **Password Security:** bcrypt hashing with account lockout protection
- **Token Management:** Blacklisting on logout, automatic expiration

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
| Role | Permissions | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Admin** | All permissions | System administration and user management |
| **Production Manager** | Production, inventory, BOM | Manufacturing operations oversight |
| **Inventory Clerk** | Inventory read/write | Stock operations and management |
| **Procurement Officer** | Procurement, suppliers | Purchase orders and supplier management |
| **Viewer** | Read-only access | Reporting and view-only operations |

### Security Headers and Middleware
- **CORS Protection:** Configurable origin allowlist
- **Rate Limiting:** 100 requests per minute per IP
- **Request Tracking:** Unique request IDs for audit trails
- **Trusted Hosts:** Production-only trusted host validation

---

## Database Integration Status

### SQLAlchemy ORM Models
✅ **Complete Implementation:**
- **19 Database Tables** across 6 functional modules
- **Proper Relationships** with foreign key constraints
- **Audit Trails** with user tracking and timestamps
- **FIFO Support** with optimized indexes for performance

### Key Database Entities
1. **User:** Authentication and authorization
2. **Warehouse:** 4 types (Raw Materials, Semi-Finished, Finished Products, Packaging)
3. **Product:** Complete product lifecycle management
4. **InventoryItem:** FIFO batch tracking with quality status
5. **StockMovement:** Complete audit trail for all operations
6. **BillOfMaterials:** Nested BOM hierarchy support
7. **ProductionOrder:** Manufacturing workflow management
8. **PurchaseOrder:** Procurement and supplier integration

### Database Performance
- **Optimized Indexes:** 45+ indexes for common query patterns
- **FIFO Index:** Specialized index for FIFO ordering performance
- **Connection Pooling:** Efficient database connection management
- **Query Optimization:** Sub-second response times for all operations

   - **Status:** Resolved - works with both SQLite and PostgreSQL

4. **Model Field Inconsistencies**
   - **Issue:** Schema and model misalignments
   - **Resolution:** Standardized field definitions across models
   - **Status:** Resolved - all models synchronized

## Frontend Integration Guide

### API Base Configuration
```typescript
// Frontend API Configuration
const API_BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:8000/api/v1';
const API_HEADERS = {
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  'Accept': 'application/json'
};
```

### Authentication Integration
```typescript
// Login Flow
const login = async (username: string, password: string) => {
  const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/auth/login`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: API_HEADERS,
    body: JSON.stringify({ username, password })
  });
  
  const data = await response.json();
  if (data.status === 'success') {
    localStorage.setItem('access_token', data.data.access_token);
    localStorage.setItem('refresh_token', data.data.refresh_token);
  }
  return data;
};

// Authenticated Requests
const authenticatedFetch = (url: string, options: RequestInit = {}) => {
  const token = localStorage.getItem('access_token');
  return fetch(url, {
    ...options,
    headers: {
      ...API_HEADERS,
      ...options.headers,
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
    }
  });
};
```

### Data Models for Frontend
All API responses follow this standard format:
```typescript
interface APIResponse<T> {
  status: 'success' | 'error';
  data?: T;

  error_code?: string;
  timestamp: string;
}

// Product Model
interface Product {
  id: number;
  code: string;

const handleAPIError = (response: APIResponse<any>) => {
  if (response.status === 'error') {
    switch (response.error_code) {
      case 'AUTHENTICATION_FAILED':
