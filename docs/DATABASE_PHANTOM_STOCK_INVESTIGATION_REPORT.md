# DATABASE PHANTOM STOCK INVESTIGATION REPORT
**Database Debugging Specialist Report**  
**Investigation Date:** 2025-08-22  
**Database:** `/Users/atacetinel/Documents/Pyhton/MRP-HorozDemir/backend/test_mrp.db`  
**Investigation Scope:** MRP phantom stock data integrity issues

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**CRITICAL FINDINGS:** The MRP system contains significant phantom stock data that allows production orders to be created when insufficient raw materials are available. Two major data integrity issues have been identified:

1. **Reservation Synchronization Failure (CRITICAL):** Inventory reserved_quantity fields are not synchronized with actual stock_reservations table
2. **Phantom Stock Calculation Error (HIGH):** System calculates 6-9 units of phantom stock availability due to reservation status mishandling

**Impact:** Production orders can be approved with insufficient materials, leading to potential production delays and incorrect MRP decisions.

---

## DETAILED FINDINGS

### 1. DATABASE STRUCTURE INTEGRITY ‚úÖ PASSED
- **Schema validation:** All table constraints, foreign keys, and indexes are properly defined
- **Data type consistency:** Decimal fields correctly configured for MRP quantities (15,4 precision)
- **Referential integrity:** No orphaned records found in critical tables
- **Constraint compliance:** No negative quantities or constraint violations detected

### 2. INVENTORY DATA INTEGRITY ‚úÖ MOSTLY CLEAN
```sql
-- Inventory Summary (19 items across 9 products, 5 warehouses)
Total Stock: 1,282 units
Total Reserved (inventory field): 6 units  
No negative quantities detected
No impossible values found
```

### 3. STOCK RESERVATIONS ANALYSIS ‚ö†Ô∏è ISSUES IDENTIFIED

**Current State:**
- 24 reservation records across multiple production orders
- Mix of ACTIVE and RELEASED status reservations
- RELEASED reservations are still consuming reservation quantities

**Critical Issue:** RELEASED reservations (18 records, 77 units) are not being properly handled in availability calculations.

### 4. PHANTOM STOCK DETECTION üö® CRITICAL ISSUES

#### Issue #1: SF-FRAME at WH0002
```
Product: SF-FRAME, Warehouse: WH0002
- Physical Stock: 50 units
- Inventory Reserved Field: 4 units
- Actual Active Reservations: 10 units
- System Calculated Available: 46 units
- True Available: 40 units
- PHANTOM STOCK: 6 units
```

#### Issue #2: PK-BOX at PACK-01
```
Product: PK-BOX, Warehouse: PACK-01
- Physical Stock: 200 units
- Inventory Reserved Field: 2 units
- Actual Active Reservations: 5 units
- System Calculated Available: 198 units
- True Available: 195 units
- PHANTOM STOCK: 3 units
```

### 5. RESERVATION STATUS INCONSISTENCIES

**Production Order #1 Analysis:**
- Status: PLANNED
- Multiple reservation records with RELEASED status (should be cleaned up)
- Active reservations: 6 units (2 records)
- Released reservations: 77 units (18 records) - NOT CLEANED UP

**Root Cause:** The system creates new reservations for production orders but fails to clean up RELEASED reservations from previous iterations or cancelled operations.

### 6. BOM VS RESERVATION VALIDATION

**Production Order Requirements vs Reservations:**
```
PO#1 (2 FP-TABLE): Requires 4 SF-FRAME + 2 PK-BOX
PO#2 (1 FP-TABLE): Requires 2 SF-FRAME + 1 PK-BOX  
PO#3 (2 FP-TABLE): Requires 4 SF-FRAME + 2 PK-BOX

Total Active Requirements: 10 SF-FRAME + 5 PK-BOX
Actual Active Reservations: 10 SF-FRAME + 5 PK-BOX ‚úÖ MATCHES
```

**However:** inventory.reserved_quantity fields show only 4 SF-FRAME + 2 PK-BOX, causing the phantom stock calculation error.

---

## ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### Primary Issue: Reservation Synchronization Failure
The `inventory_items.reserved_quantity` field is not being updated when:
1. New reservations are created in `stock_reservations` table
2. Reservation status changes from ACTIVE to RELEASED
3. Production orders are cancelled or modified

### Secondary Issue: Status Management
RELEASED reservations are not being properly cleaned up, leading to:
- Accumulation of outdated reservation records
- Confusion in reservation calculations
- Potential for double-counting in future operations

### Technical Root Cause
The application likely has two separate update paths:
1. Direct updates to `inventory_items.reserved_quantity`
2. Insertions into `stock_reservations` table

These paths are not synchronized, creating data inconsistency.

## SEVERITY ASSESSMENT

| Issue | Severity | Impact | Likelihood |
|-------|----------|---------|------------|
| Phantom Stock Calculations | **CRITICAL** | Production delays, material shortages | **HIGH** |
| Reservation Sync Failure | **CRITICAL** | Incorrect MRP decisions | **HIGH** |
| RELEASED Reservation Cleanup | **HIGH** | Data bloat, performance issues | **MEDIUM** |
| Status Management | **MEDIUM** | Historical data inconsistency | **LOW** |

---

## REMEDIATION RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions (Priority 1 - Critical)

1. **Fix Reservation Synchronization**
```sql
-- Corrective SQL to sync inventory.reserved_quantity with active reservations
UPDATE inventory_items 
SET reserved_quantity = (
    SELECT COALESCE(SUM(sr.reserved_quantity), 0)
    FROM stock_reservations sr 
    WHERE sr.product_id = inventory_items.product_id 
      AND sr.warehouse_id = inventory_items.warehouse_id 
      AND sr.status = 'ACTIVE'
)
WHERE inventory_item_id IN (4001, 2001); -- SF-FRAME and PK-BOX items
```

2. **Clean Up RELEASED Reservations**
```sql
-- Remove outdated RELEASED reservations
DELETE FROM stock_reservations 
WHERE status = 'RELEASED' 
  AND reservation_date < DATE('now', '-1 day');
```

### Short-term Actions (Priority 2 - High)

3. **Implement Database Triggers**
```sql
-- Trigger to auto-sync reserved_quantity when reservations change
CREATE TRIGGER sync_inventory_reservations 
AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON stock_reservations
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    -- Update logic to sync inventory_items.reserved_quantity
END;
```

4. **Add Database Constraints**
```sql
-- Ensure reservation consistency
ALTER TABLE inventory_items ADD CONSTRAINT chk_reservation_sync 
CHECK (reserved_quantity = (
    SELECT COALESCE(SUM(reserved_quantity), 0) 
    FROM stock_reservations 
    WHERE product_id = inventory_items.product_id 
      AND warehouse_id = inventory_items.warehouse_id 
      AND status = 'ACTIVE'
));
```

### Long-term Actions (Priority 3 - Medium)

5. **Application Code Review**
   - Review all functions that create/update stock reservations
   - Implement transactional consistency between tables
   - Add validation before production order approval

6. **Monitoring Implementation**
   - Daily phantom stock detection queries
   - Automated alerts for reservation sync failures
   - Performance monitoring for reservation cleanup

### Prevention Measures

7. **Data Validation Procedures**
```sql
-- Daily validation query to detect phantom stock
SELECT product_code, warehouse_code, phantom_stock_amount 
FROM (/* phantom stock detection query */) 
WHERE phantom_stock_amount != 0;
```

8. **Testing Protocol**
   - Unit tests for reservation synchronization
   - Integration tests for production order workflows
   - Stress tests for concurrent reservation operations

---

## TESTING VERIFICATION

To verify fixes have been applied:

1. **Run phantom stock detection query** (should return 0 phantom stock)
2. **Verify reservation sync** (inventory.reserved_quantity should match active reservations)
3. **Test production order creation** with corrected stock levels
4. **Validate MRP calculations** use true available quantities

---

## BUSINESS IMPACT

**Before Fix:**
- 6 units phantom SF-FRAME stock
- 3 units phantom PK-BOX stock
- Risk of production orders being approved without sufficient materials

**After Fix:**
- Accurate stock availability calculations
- Reliable MRP decision making
- Prevented production delays due to material shortages
