## Critical Issues (Blocking)

### 1. Application Startup Failures
**Severity:** 🔴 Critical  
**Status:** Unresolved  

**Issues Found:**
- SQLAlchemy model validation errors due to duplicate `@validates` decorators
- Pydantic schema incompatibility with `decimal_places` parameter (Pydantic v2 incompatibility)
- FastAPI dependency injection errors with `PermissionChecker` class
- Missing User model causing import failures

**Impact:** Application cannot start, making all endpoint testing impossible.

**Fixed During Testing:**
- ✅ Resolved duplicate validation functions in models (5 instances)
- ✅ Removed deprecated `decimal_places` parameters from Pydantic schemas
- ✅ Created User authentication model
- ✅ Updated database configuration to use SQLite for testing

**Still Requires Fix:**
- ❌ FastAPI dependency injection issues with permission system
- ❌ Complete application startup verification

### 2. Database Schema Issues
**Severity:** 🟡 High  
**Status:** Partially Resolved  

**Issues Found:**
- Invalid SQLAlchemy Index definitions with sort order specifications (`DESC`)
- Incorrect Column type definitions using string literals
- Import path inconsistencies between modules

**Fixed During Testing:**
- ✅ Corrected all Index definitions (removed DESC sort specifications)
- ✅ Fixed Column type definitions in AuditMixin
- ✅ Standardized import paths across models

### 3. Pydantic Schema Compatibility
**Severity:** 🟡 High  
**Status:** Resolved  

**Issues Found:**
- Multiple schema files using deprecated `decimal_places` parameter
- Incompatibility with Pydantic v2 field constraints

**Resolution:**
- ✅ Removed all `decimal_places` parameters across schema files
- ✅ Maintained validation logic through custom validators

## FIFO Logic Implementation Analysis

### Strengths ✅
- **Proper FIFO Ordering:** Uses entry_date for correct FIFO sequence
- **Batch-Level Tracking:** Each inventory item represents a specific batch
- **Cost Calculation:** Weighted average and FIFO cost calculations
- **Quality Status:** Supports quality control with status tracking

### Key FIFO Components Found:
```python
# FIFO ordering index (from inventory model)
Index('idx_inventory_fifo_order', 'product_id', 'warehouse_id', 'entry_date', 'inventory_item_id',
      postgresql_where="quality_status = 'APPROVED' AND available_quantity > 0")

# Available quantity calculation
available_quantity = Column(DECIMAL(15, 4), Computed('quantity_in_stock - reserved_quantity'))
```

### Business Rules Implemented:
1. First-In-First-Out consumption based on entry_date
2. Quality-approved stock only available for allocation
3. Reserved quantity tracking for production orders
4. Batch-level traceability with expiry date support

## Conclusion

The Horoz Demir MRP System backend demonstrates sophisticated architecture and comprehensive business logic implementation. The codebase shows professional development practices with proper separation of concerns, comprehensive data modeling, and security considerations.

However, critical startup issues prevent practical testing of the API functionality. The primary blocker is FastAPI dependency injection conflicts that need immediate resolution.

**Recommendation:** 
1. Resolve dependency injection issues (estimated 2-4 hours)
2. Complete startup testing (estimated 1-2 hours)
3. Perform comprehensive API testing (estimated 8-12 hours)
4. Implement unit test suite (estimated 16-24 hours)

**Next Steps:**
1. Backend Debugger should resolve dependency injection issues
2. Re-run API testing once application starts successfully
3. Perform end-to-end testing of FIFO logic
4. Validate all business rules and calculations

**Project Status:** Ready for debugging phase, followed by comprehensive testing.
